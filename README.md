## Macchina mechanical files

Here is where we will be keeping all of our mechanical files including: enclosure designs, PCB CAD, etc. Feel free to make suggestions, make pull requests, and generally get involved!

#### Gcode files in this repo were created with the Ultimaker 2 in mind. 

If you have a different 3D printer, use the STL files to re-create for your system.

#### Current M2 enclosures are lower profile and some XBEE modules will not fit. 

Design for taller top half of cases to follow...
